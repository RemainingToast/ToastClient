/**
 * The StringCache is the public interface for rendering of all Unicode strings using OpenType fonts. It caches the glyph layout
 * of individual strings, and it uses a GlyphCache instance to cache the pre-rendered images for individual glyphs. Once a string
 * and its glyph images are cached, the critical path in renderString() will draw the glyphs as fast as if using a bitmap font.
 * Strings are cached using weak references through a two layer string cache. Strings that are no longer in use by Minecraft will
 * be evicted from the cache, while the pre-rendered images of individual glyphs remains cached forever. The following diagram
 * illustrates how this works:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * String passed to Key object considers Entry object holds Each Glyph object GlyphCache.Entry stores
 * renderString(); all ASCII digits equal an array of Glyph belongs to only one the texture ID, image
 * mapped by weak to zero ('0'); objects which may Entry object; it has width/height and
 * weakRefCache mapped by weak not directly the glyph x/y pos normalized texture
 * to Key object stringCahe to Entry correspond to Unicode within the string coordinates.
