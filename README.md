### Installing
*I recommend using [multimc](https://multimc.org/) as it makes installing Fabric much easier.*

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/RemainingToast/toastclient/releases/)
2. After you are done [installing fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install)
3. Put `toastclient.jar` inside `.minecraft/mods/`
4. Launch Minecraft

Note (By Default):
* ClickGui Key is `RSHIFT`
* Command Prefix is `.` (`.help` for all commands)

### Building

Import ToastClient into your IDE of choice. IntelliJ Reccomended (for windows users, remove the `./` before each command).
- `./gradlew genSources`
- `./gradlew idea` for IntelliJ IDEA
- `./gradlew eclipse` for Eclipse
