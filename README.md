### Installing
*I recommend using [multimc](https://multimc.org/) as it makes installing Fabric much easier.*

1. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/RemainingToast/toastclient/releases/)
2. After you are done [installing fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install)
3. Put `toastclient.jar` inside `.minecraft/mods/`
4. Launch Minecraft

Note (By Default):
* ClickGui Key is `RSHIFT`
* Command Prefix is `.`
